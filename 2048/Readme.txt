This is my first programing assignment in Artificial Intelligent course
The 2048-GUI programe can be tested in DFS (Depth-First-Search) or BFS (Breath-First-Search) or HCB (Simple Hill Climbing) algorithms . 

- To run 2048 with DFS (the best algorithm solvers for this programe, DFS algorithm not only meets the goal 2048 but also reaches the goal 32768 ! ) , click the "DFS" radio button , enter the goal (goal must be an exponential of 2 ) then click button "Run" . Do the same with BFS and HCB .
- To reset the 2048 board to the initial state , click ESC .
